# Taskify

Taskify simplifies task management by allowing users to create daily task lists. Once a task is completed, users can effortlessly move it to the completed tasks list through a simple drag and drop action. Moreover, Taskify enables users to adjust task priorities with ease by dragging tasks to reorder them according to their preference.
